# Turn

Turn is basically a move for a role.

## 1. Single turn

In a single turn conversation, the user acts or prompts; then the model answers and the user does not continue the conversation.

## 2. Multiple turns

In a multiple turns conversation, the user acts or prompts; then the model answers and the user goes on with follow-up prompts. There should be at least 2 user prompts which includes assistant responses in between.
