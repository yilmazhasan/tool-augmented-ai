# Best practices for system instruction

## 1. Content and Language Use
- Use specific language styles that align with the intended communication style. For instance, use a "professional tone" instead of just a "respectful tone".
- Ensure summarization or output cells add value through interpretation or formatting. They should not merely repeat tool outputs.

2. ## Edge Cases:

Develop instructions to cover various scenarios, including edge cases for parameter values. This helps in identifying inconsistencies or bugs in how parameters are processed within the function.

3. ## Explicit Instructions:

Always do have explicit instructions rather than implicit behaviors or assumptions. However the mode behaves in the conversation, try to instruct in system prompt.
