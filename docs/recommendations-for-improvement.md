# Recommendations for Improvement

## Parameter documentation:

Enhance function signatures with explicit parameter documentation, including the type, purpose, and any default values.
  
## Error handling:

- In order to LLM to handle an error occurred after a bad call, it's a good practice to include how to handle certain type of errors in descriptions of either functions or parameters.
